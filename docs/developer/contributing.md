## I want to contribute to the code
Pull-requests are always welcome. However, to be accepted you have to follow those directives:

- Test your changes! Do not introduce regressions.
- Before doing any large changes, open a new ticket to start a discussion.
- If you want to add a new feature, respect the philosophy behind the Apereo projects. We focus on simplicity, we donâ€™t want to have a bloated software.
- The same apply for the user interface, simplicity and efficiency.
- Send only one pull-request for each feature or bug fix.
- A smaller pull-request is easier to review and it will be merged faster.
- Make sure the unit tests pass.
- Respect the coding standards.
- Write maintainable code, avoid code duplication, use good practices.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies.
